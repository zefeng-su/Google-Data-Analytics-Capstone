# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone

This is the capstone project offered by The Google Data Analytics Certificate I've completed in NOV 2024. The background of the project is as follows:

Cyclistic is a bike sharing program which features more than 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. It offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. It was founded in 2016 and has grown tremendously into a fleet of bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 

Previously, Cyclistic's marketing strategy tried to build the general awareness and appeal to broad consumers. It has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders while those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 

* Role: A junior data analyst at Cyclistic tasked with the overall goal (see below) of designing marketing strategies 
* Overall Goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
* Business Question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

The exploratory data analysis project is done with R studio and it goes through the 6 Phases Of Data Analysis:

* Ask: Define the problem or question to be addressed.
* Prepare: Gather and organize the data you'll need.
* Process: Clean and transform the data for analysis.
* Analyze: Explore and interpret the data to uncover insights.
* Share: Communicate findings through visualizations or reports.
* Act: Use the insights to make informed decisions or take action.
